1. **Download the Project**: Begin by downloading the project files from the provided source. This typically involves visiting a website or repository where the project is hosted and downloading the files as a compressed archive (such as a .zip file).

2. **Open Project and Run 'npm i' Command**: After downloading the project files, navigate to the directory where the project is saved on your local machine using a file explorer or terminal/command prompt. Once inside the project directory, open a terminal or command prompt window. Then, run the command `npm i` in the terminal. This command will install all the dependencies required for the project as specified in the `package.json` file.

3. **Open First Terminal and Run 'npm start' Command**: In the same terminal or command prompt window where you ran `npm i`, you'll now execute the command `npm start`. This command typically starts the development server for the project, allowing you to view and interact with the web application locally in your browser.

4. **Open Second Terminal and Run 'npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000' Command**: Now, open a new terminal or command prompt window (keeping the first one open and running). In this new terminal window, navigate to the project directory if you're not already there. Then, execute the command `npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000`. This command starts a JSON server using the provided data file (`db.json`) as a mock database and listens on port 8000. This step is often used for simulating backend functionality and serving data to the frontend during development.

By following these steps, you should have the project up and running locally on your machine, with both the frontend and backend components active and accessible. You can now proceed with development, testing, or exploration of the project's features.
